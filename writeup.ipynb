    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed\n",
    "\n",
    "My model consists of a convolution neural network with 3x3 filter sizes and depths between 32 and 256 (model.py lines 55-91) \n",
    "\n",
    "The model includes RELU layers to introduce nonlinearity (code line 55-91), and the data is normalized in the model using a Keras lambda layer (code line 57).  \n",
    "\n",
    "I used a modified VGG architecture, see below for the breakdown.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model\n",
    "\n",
    "The model contains dropout layers in order to reduce overfitting (model.py lines 61, 65, 69, 74, 79). \n",
    "\n",
    "The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (code line 233). The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Model parameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 89).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Appropriate training data\n",
    "\n",
    "Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used the Udacity data (https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/December/584f6edd_data/data.zip)  \n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted to push it as far as possible without adding additional training data. I wanted to see how far augmentation can go. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Solution Design Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "This is going to be more of a diary on how I arrived at the final architecture rather than a strategy :)\n",
    "\n",
    "My initial work was to try recording a short trip down the initial straight road so I could analyze and visualize the image and work on the data preparation. \n",
    "\n",
    "My first attempt on training was to just migrate the traffic sign network from the Keras lab and see what happens. It took me a while to connect my local simulator to a model that was running in AWS and get the car moving in autonomous mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was short on time so rather than mucking around with the simulator I chose to use the Udacity dataset rather than recording my own. First few training attempts the model would produce a steering angle in the hundreds. I decided to remove all zero steering angles and this help to produce a normal output between -1 and 1. During this process I also learnt that for a continuous prediction of steering I need to remove the last activation layer which is typically used in classification networks otherwise it becomes a % chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "My next realization was that the network was producing a constant output regardless of which image was being used for prediction, this is also seen when it seems to settle on the same loss and validation loss within 2 epochs. I further filtered out images that were less than +-0.05 steering angles along with increasing the number of samples of larger steering angles by flipping images >0.1 and <-0.1. This produced a car that continuously turned left as I ran it in the simulator. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next I applied the VGG16 network, added layers in front and back and retrained it from scratch, the car was able to drive around the track, swirving from left to right. However it did manage to drive around the track when I manually reduce the speed, I'm suspecting it's got to do with the network speed or the efficiency of the model, likely the latter. The model.h5 file is over 1 gigabyte. After updating the drive.py from the udacity repo and setting the speed to 5mph the car was able to make it over the bridge and keep going, my laptop was heating up quite bad from running the simulator though. \n",
    "\n",
    "Trying to reduce the size of the model by using a lambda calling tensor flow as a part of the model turned out to be troublesome, the model trained ok but I couldn't load it as it encountered an undefined function in the lambda. Tried reducing the image to 80x80 but the result was worse, it seems the learning rate needed to be lower for the model to learn the smaller images. I set the learning rate at 0.0001 and the car was able to go around track 1 at 15mph. \n",
    "\n",
    "I observed that the car is still swirving a lot with this model, so I added in the left and right camera images into the training sample. This made the car a lot more stable at 15mph. However, it was not able to climb hills and take sharp turns properly for the 2nd track.\n",
    "\n",
    "After doing some reading around and chatting to people on slack. I found Vivek's blog post interesting, and come to see how the generator can really make it convenient to produce more varied data for testing without having to always go through 10k images. I did a simple generator that just randomly picked images (from a sample that has already filtered out all the near 0 images) for training, this was also able to drive around the track in slow speed. \n",
    "\n",
    "After playing around a little bit. I came to the theory that it's the data that makes the difference, so I modified the sampling method to create a flatter normal distribution per batch. However this didn't turn out to work as well as I had expected. I then reverted to the original generator and tried the Nvidia model, that also didn't provide much improvement. \n",
    "\n",
    "After removing some of Vivek's ideas (transformation and random brightness), the car was more stable again and the training error was lower. I then modified the activations from relu to elu that provided a slight improvement. After removing the transform that attempts to mimic sharp turns the result was a lot better. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tested training + validation + driving at 64x64 vs 80x320, higher resolution images don't seem to make much of a difference, infact it was slightly worse at the higher resolution which was interesting. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After a week of hardly any improvement to my results, I came to the realization that my CNN layers did not have activations, which means it's a straight linear function. So happy yet so annoyed. I'm now  yielding much better results after putting activation into the convolutional layers. Threw away some of the augmentation stuff since it didn't seem to make a difference for track 1. The car can now drive at 20mph nicely on track 1, can also do it comfortably in reverse.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Still can't do 30mph yet, I suspect I will need new data for this as the steering angle will need to be lower during straights  and stronger during corners at higher speed. I'm also suspecting that my setup of having my model on AWS and running the simulator on my local inherently carries a lag effect where the car cannot respond fast enough. These are theories which I don't have enough time to investigate or confirm as I need to move on to P4. \n",
    "  \n",
    "I did not explore track 2 too much other than try it out here and there, I had hoped the model could generalize to track 2 without much work but after some brief exploration I believe I'd have to record data there. Vivek's post regarding augmentation appears to be only relevant to the old track 2 which was similar to track 1 but with shadows etc.   \n",
